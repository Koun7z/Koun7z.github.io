# **About Me**

Hi, I am {{ site.author.name }} :wave:,\
a student of Automatic Control and Robotics at AGH University of Krak√≥w. I'm an ambitious developer and an aspiring engineer. My biggest interest is low level software development, but I also feel fairly comfortable in fields related to electronics and electrical engineering.\
I created this site to share some of my knowledge, struggles, and successes as well as to document my progress and growth in this endless journey of engineering.\
I hope all of you that stumbled across this page will find something that will catch your interest.
